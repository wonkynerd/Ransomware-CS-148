# Ransomware-CS-148
Computer Science 1 Class Project

This program was written with the help and instruction from w3w3w3 YouTube video on Ransomware. I used this project for my Computer Science 1 class to present on the anatomy of ransomware and to give a brief demonstration. Although I used a tutorial for this project, my predominant goal was to learn the workings of a basic ransomware script which was
readable and understandable for me. I started the project barely knowing anything about ransomware to having the ability to read the python script and understand what each and every function was doing. I learned about the imported modules and how they work within a program, RSA encryption with the use of public and private keys, decryption, and threading. Overall, my primary goal was achieved throughout this project. 

My colleague and I plan to create a more advanced script by utilizing steganography and having the ransomware program auto-execute once the media the ransomware is hidden in is downloaded. This project is soon to come!
